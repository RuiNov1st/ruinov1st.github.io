I am currently a first-year PhD student at the `National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC)`, majoring in Astronomical Techniques and Methodology. My research interests lie in AI for Astronomy, particularly in using deep learning for galaxy physical property estimation and developing multi-modal algorithms for astronomical data analysis.
