Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) are one of the main targets of the DESI survey, with a redshift range from 0.6 to 1.6. According to previous studies, using only multiband imaging or photometric data makes it difficult to obtain accurate photometric redshifts for ELGs. In this work, we implement a multi-modal algorithm that combines multi-band imaging and photometric data to achieve more precise redshift measurements. In this talk, I introduced the background of the DESI survey, the challenges in ELG photometric redshift estimation, the construction of multi-modal astronomical datasets, the proposed algorithm, and the corresponding results.
