In the summer of 2025, I worked as a summer student with Iva at the MPIA Data Science Department. We looked at several dwarf galaxies identified in the JWST OutThere Survey and used Surface Brightness Fluctuation (SBF) to estimate their distances. This talk was presented as a stage report to summarize the progress of distance calculations, including the introduction to the OutThere Survey, the SBF methodology, and our preliminary distance results, although several photometric issues still remain to be resolved.
